# SomaFM integration for Home Assistant

This HACS integration adds all SomaFM stations to the media player.
SomaFM stations are a regular audio media resource, so can be cast or listened to in-tab.

This integration loads the station list from the SomaFM website on each load, so is always up to date.

## Installation
