# SomaFM integration for home assistant

This integration adds all SomaFM stations to a Media page.
Stations are a regular audio media resource, so can be casted or listened to in-tab.
Although there is an existing radio plugin, I found it difficult to navigate and search, and its catalog was outdated.
This integration loads the station list from the SomaFM website on each load, so is always up to date.

## Installation

Clone this repo into your `CONFIG/custom_components/somafm` directory:

```
mkdir custom_components
git clone https://github.com/maddyblue/hass-somafm.git custom_components/somafm
```

Then restart home assistant.
